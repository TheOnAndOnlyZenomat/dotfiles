* Hintergrund
She grew up in a very wealthy familiy near Waterdeep. She lived a very protected life without much freedoms and therefore does not have much reallife experience.
Her only friends were the maids which her father hired for her.
She is a very educated girl, because her parents forced her to take classes in al kinds of sciences and forced her to learn Elvish. She also got educated in the arts of gardening and know a lot about plants. During her gardening lessons her proficiency for this art was discovered, leading to her parents hiring a teacher to educated her in the devine arts of nature.
Those lessons were the only ones she actually enjoyed.
Her parents, being very rich, did not have much time for her, because they were busy doing buisness, so Trissis relationship with her parents is rather cold and distant.
Trissi also grew up to a lot of tales, especially the tales of the great Garholm, hero of the dwarfs, and always wanted to experience such adventures. When she asked her parents about it, she was instantly shutdown and even more protected and locked away from the world.
Trissi, not being satisfied with that answer and not at all happy with her situation grabs all the valuables she can find, takes two sickles and flees on a night with no moon.
