* Hintergrund
She grew up in a very wealthy familiy near Waterdeep. She lived a very protected life without much freedoms and therefore does not have much reallife experience.
Her only friends were the maids which her father hired for her.
Her parents, being very rich, did not have much time for her, because they were busy doing buisness, so Trissis relationship with her parents is rather cold and distant.
Trissi also grew up to a lot of tales, especially the tales of the great Garholm, hero of the dwarfs, and always wanted to experience such adventures. When she asked her parents about it, she was instantly shutdown and even more protected and locked away from the world.
Trissi, not being satisfied with that answer and not at all happy with her situation she grabs all the valuables she can find, takes a degen and flees on a night with no moon
