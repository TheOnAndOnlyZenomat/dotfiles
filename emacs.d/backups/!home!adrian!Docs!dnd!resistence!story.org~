** Leizpiger Meuten
+ https://blog.zeit.de/stoerungsmelder/2012/03/15/der-vergessene-widerstand-leipzigs-jugend-gegen-hitler_8255
+ up to 1500 teenagers as oppositon to the nazis and the HJ
+ mostly between 14 and 18
+ moslty out of the working class with sozialdemocratic or communistic parents
+ wore short leathertrousers and chequered hemden, colorful neckties
+ badges were very important, for example skull-badges, or marriage rings, withour being married
+ made up out of man and woman, but woman were degraded from the Stasi to sexual objects
+ very good relations with other groups
+ if they met the HJ, dann krieg
+ Gestapo at first did not see them as a threat, but later prosecuted them
+ wanted to scare the masses by sentencing a few for treason, a few of them landed in KZ's, some in **prison (maybe rescue one of them)** for a few years
+ but no effect, so they started to execute mass arrests and build teenager KZ's (hard work, reeducation)

* Kommunitischer Wiederstand
+ http://prisma.blogsport.de/2017/01/11/kommunistischer-widerstand-in-leipzig-1943/
+ at first hope for a fast end, but that did not happen
+ no more public actions, but holding up conntact to allies
+ Lost battle of Stalingrad for Germany, new hope and continuation of resistence
+ 4 different groups, connected in discussion and so on, but not really connected because of different political views and the difficulty of the illegal work

** First group
+ Georg Schumann, Otto Engert, Kurt Kresse
+ WW II is an imperialistic war, allies also responsible for the war
+ because of that, they wanted to fight together with the sojets against the allies
+ later demanded that the west victors should aknowledge the independece of Germany

** Second Group
+ William Zipperer, Arthur Hoffman, Karl Jungbluth
+ thought that that plan was follish and assumed a weakness of the left movement
+ demanded instant end of the war and the creation of a frontline of all antifashistic powers to build a democratic afterwargermany

** Third Group
+ Rudolf Hardtmann, Kurt Rosberf, Krl Plesse
+ demanded instant, no compromiss end of the war
+ Hardmann imprisoned in dezember of 1942, for two years, after that into the KZ
+ under torture he disclosed othe resistence members **(maybe have to rescue him)**

** Fourth Group / Internationale Antifaschistisches Komitee (IAK)
+ e.g. Family Hauke, sowjet laborprisoners and POWs
+ planed to act, when the red army arrived
+ 31.05.1944 IAK was "caught"



+ after the devestating bombing of leizpig the spread out fliers with the call to resistence, interrupt the warproduction and seek shelter in case of an attack instead of staying at the workplace
+ multiple V-Maenner in the groups
+ torture and blackmailing of the memebers
+ Summer of 1944 coordinated an country wide strike against communist resistence
+ a lot of memebers did not disclose unknown members and only admit to already known facts
+ only Hardtmann also disclosed other stuff -> tryed suicide on the 29.09.1944 out of dispair
+ a lot of death sentences in the dezember of 1944
+ leaders were executed on the 11. january 1945 in the yeard of the dresdner landgerichts
+ some could flee in the 13th February of 1945 because a bombing got the prison (Alfred Schellenberger, Frit Gietzelt)
+ Max hauke and Carl Riter were not able to be executed, because their record were burned **(taks for the gang)**

* Plan first season
1. get to a resistence group
2. initial test, get send to steal something
3. have to find out, where person is held, maybe attend party and gather intel
4. free CI (he knows how to attack)
5. attack and overtake Erla Werke/MIMO

* Get to a resistence group
+ gang has their chars with their backstory, magic allowed, need a reason, whey they not at the front
+ can decide how their morning looks
