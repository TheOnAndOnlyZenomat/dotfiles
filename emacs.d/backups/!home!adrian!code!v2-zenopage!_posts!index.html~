<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I am a 17 y/o guy living Germany. I am interested in tech, Linux, FOSS and selfhosting.
</p>

<p>
I love tinkering around with my linux box and try to get away from big tech firms like Google, Microsoft and so on.
</p>

<p>
For this I selfhost some services like Jellyfin, my mediaserver, a Matrix server so that I can chat with my family, my own blog and website, TinyTiny RSS and Wallabag.
</p>

<p>
I am also thinking about transitioning to selfhosting my music, but that I am still figuring out.
