I am very content with my Linux system configuration. This includes my window manager (dwm), my terminal (st), my bar (dwmblocks). And in it of it self, that is a really good thing. I have an environment, which I crafted to my needs, in which I feel comfortable.

The problem with this is, that I realy love tinkering with systems and software.
