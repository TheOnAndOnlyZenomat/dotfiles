+ can have a postive effect by introducing a person to new things, whish they would like to support (also called the sampling effect)
+ of course can have the negative effect, that people rather pirat than to buy, but as far as I know some pirats still try to support, by buying merch or ohter stuff from the artist
+ lack of better alternatives
+ you dont own the stuff you bought
+ trying things befor buying

For this story it is important to know, that I have a Raspberry Pi with Kodi connected to my TV as a substitute for a smart TV. On this kodi box I also have the Netflix Addon installed, so that I can watch Netflix without actually owning a smart TV.
Imagine me paying 14€ a month for a 4k netflix package and wanting to watch the movie Red Sparrow. And as I am about to select this movie on my Kodi box I see that it is only avaible in 540p SD quality... I checked on my main desktop (a Linux box with Firefox) and it runs at least in 1080p, so it was not that the quality of the movie is that bad.

I pay for 4k and I am not even allowed to watch my content in 1080p, just because I use another client?
I can of course understand the point of Netflix. An unsupported client may pose a security risk, but it still bugs me.

This is not that severe of a case, because I just rent this movie from Netflix, I know that and I also know, that they are allowed to choose the ways in which they want to distribute their content, but another case is Blu-Ray's on Linux. It is not officially possible to play Blu-Ray's on Linux, because there is no official software for it. It is locked down by DRM, eventhough you legally bought this movie or series or whatever is on there.

This is one of the core reasons, why people pirate stuff. Because their legally purchased media dictates how them how they are allowed to use it. If I buy for example a book, I expect to be allowed to read it in the park or upside down in my car, without the book changing the order of it's words, if I do not sit with a perfect posture in a licenced chair.
It is totaly understandable, that people get upset by this and search for an alternative.

Another reason is, that one has to subscribe to dozens of streaming services to watch all the shows they want. In the beginning, there was only Netflix and maybe Amazon Prime. I would not have a problem with spending 20€ a month to watch everything I want, but now there is Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Disney +, HBO and so on. You would pay a fortune and still not have access to everything. Let's take animes for example. Some stuff you just do not get, either because the streaming service in your region does not have it, or because they do not have it in generell. So if you want to watch that anime you have to fly to Japan or something to buy the Disks? Not really an option.

Afte following the r/piracy subreddit for a while I got the picture, that there is almost something like the universal aggreement, that piracy would be dead, if there were reasonable ways to consume the desired media, without bullshit restrictions imposed by companies. A lot of people on there even buy something like merch from the artists they pirate from to support them. This shows, that the reason they pirate this stuff is not because they refuse to give them money for their work. They get, that they also need to meet months end. This understandment is a bit lower if it goes against big corps tho. Here it is something like a little restience against them, a little insurgency trying to fight the mighty opponent, because he imposes shity rules, which are very anti-consumer.
